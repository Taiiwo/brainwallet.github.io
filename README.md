======================

JavaScript Client-Side Bitcoin Signing and Verification Tool

This tool is designed to help you create compact Bitcoin signatures
for use in your contracts. A key feature that this tool has is the 
ability to sign and verify documents with Bitcoin signatures already
embedded.
